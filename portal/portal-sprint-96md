## General

### Show ft-Partners on Main Page

Since our partner network is currently rapidly growing we wanted to give users the chance to see where our partners are located. If users are navigating to the main page of the different markets (https://portal.fiskaltrust.de) they should see a map with all the partners in the specific market.

## Rollout Platform

### Rollout planning in public preview (DE)

## Middleware Configuration

### Inform users about new middleware releases (DE)

To make sure that users that are using the ft-Middleware are aware of latest releases the PosCreator Experience Team reached out to us to dicuss how we can improve the portal to highlight new release of the middleware. After several ideas we decided to display the information in the configuration section of the portal so if users are navigating to one of the subpages they will be informed about new releases and can directly navigate to the release notes. By clicking on the X icon it is possible to hide this information.

### Show Last Rebuild Time of CashBox

## E-Commerce

### Warn users before logging out if Products are in the cart

Some of our customers reached out to us that they accidentaly logged out of their user while having many items in the cart. Because of the fact that the cart isn't persisted this leads to a lost state. This is especially problematic while surrogating since the location of the logout button and the "go-back" button are very close. To prevent these unintended logouts while having something in the cart we added a warning that will be shown in case users are logging out while something is in the cart.

## User Management

### Highlight the unalterability of outletnumbers

Users can define multiple fields for outlets. One of them is the so called outletnumber. This field is used for internally identifying the connection between middleware components and the outlet. Therefore this field cannot be changed after it has been asigned. To make sure that users are aware of this limitation we added additional information to the outlet dialogs.

### Replaced legacy map with enhanced map control

In the past we have been using the Bing Maps control to indicate the current location of accounts. We have replaced this legacy control by a new component.

## Next steps
In the next weeks we will focus on improving the performance of the portal in addition to a brand new component that should greatly enhance the rollout experience.

## Feedback
We would love to hear what you think about these improvements and fixes. To get in touch, please reach out to [info@fiskaltrust.at](mailto:info@fiskaltrust.at).
