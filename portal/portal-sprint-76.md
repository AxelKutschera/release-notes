# fiskaltrust.Portal - Sprint 75
_June 22, 2020_

## Features and general improvements

### New Export Experience

### New Auto Onboarding Experience for PosDealers


- In the past we have not seperated the template-based-products for different markets. This led to the fact that we have shown all of these products in the shop. We have made some changes to being able to separate these products between the markets and now only products that are really available for the given market are shown.
- Users should be able now to execute exports for FR very fast. Further information on this new exporting feature in the New Export Page section
- Similar to the other SCUs we do have a Diebold Nixdorf specific configuration page now that should make configuring the Diebold Nixdorf SCU easier for the users

## Stability improvements and bugfixes
-When updating a Configuration in the Bulkupdate Interface a 500 error occurred. This issue was fixed and the functionality for updating middleware componenents and rebuilding the cashboxes automatically is back again.

## Next steps
In the upcoming sprints, the development team will mostly focus on further improving the customer onboarding experience in the Portal.

In addition to this, we will continue to improve the _Export_ features in the portal and offer additional exports for DE.
