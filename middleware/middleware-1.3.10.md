# fiskaltrust.Middleware 1.3.10 (Germany)
_October 28, 2020_

We're happy to announce that starting from this version, we provide SCUs for all currently certified TSEs, as well as SCUs for two major cloud TSEs that are currently in certification (fiskaly and A-Trust). While some of those are still only available on the sandbox, we consider them production-ready and are working closely with our partners to push them to production as soon as possible.

In addition to this, we resolved several important stability issues in version 1.3.10, which should result in an overall greatly increased reliability, especially when working with Swissbit SCUs. Also, we fixed an important issue in our SQLite implementation that lead to data not being 100% correctly read from the database (although no data was lost, as everything was written correctly).

**We highly recommend updating to this version on POS Systems that use SQLite Queues to resolve this issue.**

## Bug fix: Receipt journal decimal value is cut while reading in SQLite
Due to an issue in our SQLite implementation, we were missing precision in the `ftReceiptTotal` field while _reading_ receipt journals. Writing data was **not** affected, as all values were stored correctly. Additionally, this value is **not** used internally (i.e. for chaining, ...).

This issue was now resolved.

## Bug fix: Using float types for MySQL entities
While fixing the previous issue, we noticed a similar problem in our new MySQL queue. This was now resolved, and precision is now read correctly here as well.

## Bug fix: Exclude "Other processes"/"Andere VorgÃ¤nge" from cashpoint closing module in DSFinV-K export
Both during our internal tests and due to customer feedback, we noticed that the cashpoint closing module ("Kassenabschlussmodul") in the DSFinV-K contained too many entries, leading to wrong turnovers (e.g. if a receipt sequence contained the same items in _info-order_ and _POS receipt_ requests). This issue was now resolved, as the cashpoint closing module should only contain data from bons of the type _Beleg_.

## Stability improvement: Fixed concurrency issues in Swissbit SCU
We fixed a concurrency issue in our Swissbit SCU that lead to failed receipts and a switch to the failover-mode in some cases. While not many POS implementations were affected by this, the issue was occurring frequently for some customers, and was therefore now fixed.

## New SCU: Epson (Sandbox)
Previously to this version, our Epson SCU was still based on our interface 1.3.0 and hence incompatible to newer Queues (with version >= 1.3.1). While updating this SCU to the latest interface version, we greatly improved the stability and especially the compatibility, which now works with USB devices, printers, and Epson TSE servers.

We are working closely together with our partners to evaluate this SCU and will push it to production as soon as we gathered enough feedback to be confident that everything is working as expected in real-world scenarios.

## How to update
Existing configurations with versions greater than 1.3.1 continue to work, **but we strongly recommend users to update, as this new version should vastly improve the Middleware's reliability**.

As always, updates can be rolled out by selecting the new version in the fiskaltrust.Portal and re-building the configuration. The updated Middleware instances will then automatically pull the new packages at the next startup.

## Affected packages
Packages not listed here were not updated, as we decided to not increase the version of unchanged packages. All packages with versions greater or equal to 1.3.1 are compatible with each other (it is e.g. possible to use _fiskaltrust.Middleware.SCU.Swissbit.1.3.1_ with the new queue packages).

## Next steps in the Middleware
