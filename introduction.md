# fiskaltrust Release Notes
In this section, the development team directly publishes release notes for our customer-facing products and services. Right now, this affects the Middleware and the Portal.

- These release notes will contain a sum-up of all customer-relevant changes that were made. Depending on the service, the severity of the change, and the affected markets, these changes may already be rolled out for some time when they are published here. 

- Depending on the product or service, release notes will be published frequently (for web services like the Portal), or each time a new release version is created (for on-premise products like the Middleware).

To proceed, please open the section of interest to the left. If you have any questions regarding the changes described here, please directly reach out to us via [info@fiskaltrust.de](mailto:info@fiskaltrust.de) / [info@fiskaltrust.at](mailto:info@fiskaltrust.at) / [info@fiskaltrust.fr](mailto:info@fiskaltrust.fr).
